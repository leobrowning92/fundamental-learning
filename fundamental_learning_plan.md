# Fundamental learning Plan

## 2019-08-20

### Todo:
- [x] implement tfidf in word vector experiment in `2019-07-22_fundamental-learning_GloVe-exploration.ipynb`
- [ ] Go over snippets of maxs network code and corresponding modern papers in `2019-08-20_fundamental-learning_papertopytorch_fromMax.ipynb`
- [x] Read RNN section in NN Textbook
- [ ] Decide on next project

### Medium term goals
- Go over max's transformer talk from data science day after having had some exposure to Attention, RNNs and Transformers
- character level RNN in pytorch as in karpathy blog/gist as a project. Can contrast with transformer in future.

### Outcome
- Identified the need to understand RNN and then transformers while looking through max's code-paper examples
- Need to better track learning progress, objectives and goals, hence this doc.
